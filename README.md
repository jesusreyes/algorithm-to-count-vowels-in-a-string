# Project Description
This program defines a string and counts how many vowels (a, e, i, o, u) are present in that string. It then displays the count of vowels.
# How the Project Works
Start your script by defining a sentence as a string. Here is an example:

``  text = "Hello, how many vowels are in this sentence?"   ``

Here is how the program behaves when run:

``The number of vowels in the string is: 13``
